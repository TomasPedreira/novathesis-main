\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

\paragraph{}In the previous chapters, the reasons for the development of this work, such as 
the increase of the population or the lack of labour, were presented. The state of the art was 
also presented, with the most popular methods for path planning and Robot control. Some 
of the cited works showed promising methods for the development of this work, with the most promising 
being the use of the Voronoi Graph along with the A* algorithm for path planning and the Pure Pursuit 
controllers for forward and reverse control. A work proposal was made showing the required actions 
to take to finish the work along with a schedule and a results publishing plan. With that, it will 
be possible to make a system that can be of help to the world of Smart Agriculture.
